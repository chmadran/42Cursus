<h2> LIBFT </h2>

GRADE : 125 / 100

In the first part, remake of a set of functions from the libc. The functions have the
same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They comply
with the way they are defined in their man.

In the second part, development of a set of functions that are either not in the libc,
or that are part of it but in a different form. Finally, implementation of functions manipulating lists.
